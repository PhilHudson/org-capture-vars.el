* org-capture-vars.el
** User-defined capture variables and prompts for Org-mode

~(ocv/prmt PROMPT VARIABLE &optional DEFAULT COMPLETIONS)~

For example, you might define an Org capture template for capturing
JIRA tickets like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org-mode
   * JIRA Ticket %(ocv/prmt "JIRA Ticket No." 'jr-no)
     I have to do the following stuff:
   ** Triage %(progn jr-no)
   #+END_SRC
   
to be prompted for the JIRA ticket number to enter. Your entered text
will be stored in buffer-local variable ~jr-no~. If you enter, say,
"4321" at the prompt, your capture output will look like:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org-mode
   * JIRA Ticket 4321
     I have to do the following stuff:
   ** Triage 4321
   #+END_SRC

The optional third argument lets you specify an initial default input
value.

If you have a list of completions you want to use, you can pass that
as the optional fourth argument:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org-mode
   * Next meeting at %(ocv/prmt "Location" 'mtg-loc 'mtg-locs)
   #+END_SRC
